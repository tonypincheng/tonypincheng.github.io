I’m a Ph.D. candidate at UC San Diego and Altos Labs, specializing in single-cell genomics and bioinformatics. Based in San Diego, I work in the Kun Zhang Lab, where I developed RETrace v2—a dual-omic platform integrating DNA and methylation data, boosting lineage tracing resolution 300-fold. I code in Python, R, and Linux/Bash, building pipelines to analyze NGS data and explore cancer, aging, and regenerative medicine.

Originally from in Taichung, Taiwan, I hold an M.D. from Kaohsiung Medical University and an M.S. from USC in stem cell biology. Before genomics, I researched neurodegeneration and stem cell aging. I’m passionate about using high-throughput technologies and computational tools to improve healthcare and make an impact. Outside the lab, I love San Diego’s beaches and exploring Taiwanese food and boba.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
