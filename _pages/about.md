Hi, I am Tony Cheng.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/) and [Altos Labs](https://www.altoslabs.com/), specializing in single-cell genomics and bioinformatics. 

Based in San Diego, I work in the Kun Zhang Lab, where I developed RETrace v2—a dual-omic platform integrating DNA and methylation data, boosting lineage tracing resolution 300-fold. I code in Python, R, and Linux/Bash, building pipelines to analyze NGS data and explore cancer, aging, and regenerative medicine.

Originally from Taichung, Taiwan, I hold an M.D. from Kaohsiung Medical University and an M.S. from USC in stem cell biology. Before genomics, I researched neurodegeneration and stem cell aging. 

I’m passionate about using high-throughput technologies and computational tools to improve healthcare and make an impact. 

Outside the lab, I love San Diego’s beaches and exploring Taiwanese food and boba.
